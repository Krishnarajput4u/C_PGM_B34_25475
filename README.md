# 🤖 C Codes – Beginner Edition

Welcome to my **C Programming Zoo** 🦁🐢🐒
Here you’ll find wild creatures called **codes** written by a beginner (that’s me 👋).

---

## 📂 What’s Inside?

* 🐣 **Hello World** (the egg every programmer hatches from)
* 🔄 Loops that loop so much they confuse me more than the compiler
* ❓ If-Else statements (because life is full of conditions)
* 🔢 Math programs (aka making my PC do my homework)
* 🎨 Pattern printing (stars, triangles, maybe even UFO landing pads ⭐👽)

## ⚙️ How to Use This Repo

1. Clone it like you’re stealing code from your future self:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krishnarajput4u/C_PGM_B34_25475.git
   ```
2. Compile with GCC (aka “the thing that yells at me with errors”):

   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output
   ```
3. Pray it works 🙏 (if not, it’s not a bug, it’s a *feature*).

## 🎯 Mission

* Become a **C master** one semicolon at a time.
* Debug until I cry 💧 (then fix it).
* Look back one day and say, *“wow, I used to write this?!”*

## 🤝 Contributions

* Feel free to suggest better ways to code

## 📝 Note from Me

Every programmer’s journey begins with a **semicolon error**.
This is mine 🚀.
